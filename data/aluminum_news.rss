The deal is framed around capturing growing demand and improving supply security in the copper market, with the combined entity expected to control a significantly larger share of global mine output and project pipelines.[5]</description><category>copper</category></item><item><title>Copper supply shortfall expected to widen</title><link>https://www.iom3.org/resource/copper-supply-shortfall-expected-to-widen.html</link><description>A summary of the S&amp;P Global *Copper in the Age of AI* study explains that copper demand is expected to increase by 50% to 42 million metric tons by 2040, driven by AI-related electricity use, defense spending, energy transition technologies, and core economic growth.[5] Even with a projected doubling of recycled copper scrap from 4 to 10 million metric tons, the article stresses that new and expanded mines will be needed due to technical, environmental, and regulatory hurdles facing primary production.[5]</description><category>copper</category></item><item><title>Global Demand for Copper Surges 50% by 2040</title><link>https://discoveryalert.com.au/copper-essential-role-modern-economies-2026/</link><description>This piece discusses how electrification, AI infrastructure, and renewable energy are set to push global copper demand up by about 50% by 2040, based largely on findings from S&amp;P Global’s *Copper in the Age of AI* study.[6][3] It emphasizes that without major investment in mining, processing, and recycling technologies, copper could shift from being an enabler of the energy transition and digitalization to a constraint on sustainable growth.[6][3]</description><category>copper</category></item><item><title>Nickel Plunges from Over 2-Year High as Markets Reassess Indonesian Output Cuts</title><link>https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/nickel/news/515604</link><description>Nickel futures fell to about $17,100 per tonne after briefly touching a more than two-year high of $18,875 on January 6, as traders reassessed the scale and credibility of Indonesia’s proposed 34% cut to its 2026 nickel mining quota.[2] Despite talk of curbs, Russia’s Nornickel still projects a 275,000-tonne surplus next year and LME stockpiles climbed to 255,000 tonnes in 2025, underscoring ongoing oversupply concerns.[2]</description><category>nickel</category></item><item><title>Pressure for Indonesian Quota U-Turn Is a Risk for Nickel Price Rally</title><link>https://www.mining.com/web/pressure-for-indonesian-quota-u-turn-is-a-risk-for-nickel-price-rally/</link><description>Indonesia, which accounts for about 70% of global nickel production (around 3.8 million tonnes last year), has lifted prices close to 19‑month highs by announcing cuts to mining quotas aimed at boosting revenues.[5] Analysts warn the rally may be short‑lived because many new Indonesian projects are due onstream in 2026 and industry pressure could force the government to ease quotas later in the year, allowing miners to reapply for higher production permits.[5]</description><category>nickel</category></item><item><title>Acciaierie d'Italia to start preferential negotiations with Azerbaijani consortium on acquisition of former Ilva plants</title><link>https://www.steelorbis.com/steel-news/latest-news/acciaierie-ditalia-to-start-preferential-negotiations-with-azerbaijani-consortium-on-acquisition-of-former-ilva-plants-1384557.htm</link><description>Extraordinary commissioners of Acciaierie d’Italia and ILVA in extraordinary administration have requested authorization from Italy’s Ministry of Enterprises and Made in Italy to begin preferential negotiations with an Azerbaijani consortium (Baku Steel Company CJSC and Azerbaijan Investment Company OJSC) for the sale of the former Ilva steel plants.[8] Ten proposals had been received by the January 10 deadline, and the chosen consortium was selected based on criteria including financial stability, industrial sustainability, and expected benefits for employment and local communities.[8]</description><category>steel</category></item></channel></rss>
