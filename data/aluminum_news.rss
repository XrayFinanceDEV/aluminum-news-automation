driving nickel demand and examines technological and supply‑chain innovations to keep EV growth sustainable.[2] The article highlights alternative chemistries like LFP and sodium‑ion, material innovation toward low‑nickel or nickel‑free batteries, and advanced recycling to create a more circular, resilient nickel supply chain.[2]</description><category>nickel</category></item><item><title>Nickel's role in the future of safer electric vehicle batteries</title><link>https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/nickels-role-in-the-future-of-safer-electric-vehicle-batteries/56357/</link><description>Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin and Argonne National Laboratory have conducted an extensive study on high‑nickel cathodes for EV batteries, detailing how nickel’s high energy density can be harnessed while addressing safety and stability challenges.[3] By mapping critical states of charge and understanding metal‑oxygen bond strength and surface reactivity, the work proposes guidelines for safer, more efficient nickel‑rich battery designs that support the clean‑energy transition.[3]</description><category>copper</category></item><item><title>Copper Cables: Antitrust Launches Investigation into Alleged Cartel – Prysmian and Nexans Down on the Stock Exchange</title><link>https://www.firstonline.info/en/cavi-in-rame-antitrust-avvia-indagine-su-presunto-cartello-prysmian-e-nexans-in-calo-in-borsa/</link><description>Italy’s antitrust authority (AGCM) has opened an investigation into several major low‑voltage copper cable manufacturers in Italy, including Prysmian Cavi e Sistemi Italia, over alleged price‑fixing conduct dating back to 2005.[2] The probe, still at an early stage, triggered share price declines for Prysmian and Nexans, though analysts currently expect only a negligible impact on Prysmian given that the Italian low‑voltage copper cable market represents less than 3% of its revenues.[2]</description><category>copper</category></item><item><title>Aluminium alloy futures fluctuate at highs, and short-term macro tailwinds boost the market</title><link>https://www.alcircle.com/press-release/aluminium-alloy-futures-fluctuate-at-highs-and-short-term-macro-tailwinds-boost-the-market-116875</link><description>This report notes that aluminium alloy futures in China have been fluctuating at relatively high levels, supported by macroeconomic tailwinds and firm cost support.[3] SHFE data show total registered cast aluminium alloy warrant volumes around 69,922 tonnes as of January 9, 2026, indicating ample exchange stocks even as prices resume an upward trend.[3]</description><category>aluminum</category></item><item><title>Acciaierie d'Italia to start preferential negotiations with Azerbaijani consortium on acquisition of former Ilva plants</title><link>https://www.steelorbis.com/steel-news/latest-news/acciaierie-ditalia-to-start-preferential-negotiations-with-azerbaijani-consortium-on-acquisition-of-former-ilva-plants-1384557.htm</link><description>Extraordinary commissioners of Acciaierie d’Italia and ILVA in extraordinary administration have requested authorization from Italy’s Ministry of Enterprises and Made in Italy to begin preferential negotiations with an Azerbaijani consortium (Baku Steel Company CJSC and Azerbaijan Investment Company OJSC) for the sale of the former Ilva steel plants.[8] Ten proposals had been received by the January 10 deadline, and the chosen consortium was selected based on criteria including financial stability, industrial sustainability, and expected benefits for employment and local communities.[8]</description><category>steel</category></item></channel></rss>
