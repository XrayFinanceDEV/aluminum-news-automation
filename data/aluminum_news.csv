TECH Project high-grade nickel is primed to fuel the global green transition,Innovation News Network,2026-01-25T05:24:08.868741,"Queensland Pacific Metals’ TECH Project aims to become the world’s premier source of high-grade, ethically derived nickel for lithium-ion batteries in EVs and green energy. The project uses the innovative DNi Process, which recycles over 98% of nitric acid, requires no tailings dams, and produces minimal waste, making it a carbon-negative facility. It supports sustainable supply chains with partnerships like GM securing nickel and cobalt production options.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/tech-project-high-grade-nickel-is-primed-to-fuel-the-global-green-transition/32893/,nickel technology innovation sustainability,nickel,2026-01-25T05:24:08.868727
CATL and the Ellen Macarthur Foundation Set Direction for Circular EV Batteries with Landmark Whitepaper,PR Newswire,2026-01-25T05:24:08.868758,"CATL collaborates with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation on a whitepaper outlining circular economy principles for EV batteries, achieving 99.6% recovery rates for nickel, cobalt, and manganese. The approach reduces demand for virgin materials, lowers emissions, and supports supply chain resilience through high-quality recycling at scale. It aligns with CATL's carbon neutrality goals and promotes alternative chemistries like sodium-ion batteries.",https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/catl-and-the-ellen-macarthur-foundation-set-direction-for-circular-ev-batteries-with-landmark-whitepaper-302669433.html,nickel technology innovation sustainability,nickel,2026-01-25T05:24:08.868755
Greener method recovers critical metals from spent batteries,TechXplore,2026-01,"Researchers at Monash University developed a mild deep eutectic solvent (DES) process to recover over 95% of high-purity nickel, cobalt, manganese, and lithium from spent lithium-ion batteries, including complex black mass. This sustainable method avoids high temperatures and hazardous chemicals, offering a safer alternative for recycling and advancing a circular economy for critical metals. It also shows potential for recovering metals from electronic waste and mine tailings.",https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-greener-method-recovers-critical-metals.html,nickel technology innovation sustainability,nickel,2026-01-25T05:24:08.868769
