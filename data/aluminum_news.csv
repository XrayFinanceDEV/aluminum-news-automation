Indonesia quota talk triggers nickel reality check,mining.com,2026-02-11T06:05:40.655095,"Talk of Indonesia capping 2026 nickel ore at 250 million tonnes, down from 379 million, could remove 700,000 tonnes of supply and flip the market to deficit, surging prices. However, physical oversupply persists, with large LME warranting pressuring near-term prices. Limited non-Chinese processing capacity poses bottlenecks for new supply.",https://www.mining.com/indonesia-quota-talk-triggers-nickel-reality-check/,nickel production and capacity,nickel,2026-02-11T06:05:40.655093
UCLA Scientists Revive Edison's Forgotten Battery Design,Mirage News,2026-02-11T06:05:46.324301,"An international research collaboration co-led by UCLA has revived Thomas Edison's nickel-iron battery technology using proteins to grow tiny metal clusters embedded in ultrathin carbon conductors. The prototype recharges in seconds and withstands over 12,000 cycles, equivalent to more than 30 years of daily use, making it suitable for renewable energy storage. Researchers are exploring scalable alternatives to bovine proteins for future manufacturing.",https://www.miragenews.com/ucla-scientists-revive-edisons-forgotten-1617158/,nickel technology innovation sustainability,nickel,2026-02-11T06:05:46.324293
Top Fiber Laser Cutting Machine Manufacturers Driving Innovation in Metal Fabrication,National Law Review,02-10-2026,"Fiber laser technology is replacing traditional CO2 systems in manufacturing due to higher efficiency (25-40% vs. 10-15%), lower costs, and extended service life up to 100,000 hours. It supports precision cutting of nickel alloys for aerospace and high-strength steels for electric vehicles, aiding sustainability through reduced energy use and emissions. Environmental regulations further drive adoption by minimizing carbon footprints.",https://natlawreview.com/press-releases/top-fiber-laser-cutting-machine-manufacturers-driving-innovation-metal,nickel technology innovation sustainability,steel,2026-02-11T06:05:46.324307
